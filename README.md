# JQ
Joinquant(www.joinquant.com) is an online powerful backtesting framework and is also easy to use. Even beginners can quickly figure out how to develop and share their own strategies in the first few hours with it, making it the biggest quant forum in China. However, Joinquant does not support deep learning packages such as Pytorch and TensorFlow and has serious speed problems while backtesting. This limits the diversity and complexity of my strategies and significantly drags the progress of my strategy development. To overcome its limitations while leveraging its advantages, I decided to develop a local backtesting framework with well-designed APIs, strong speed performance, and good scalability.
